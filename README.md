# PvZ Heroes Card Editor
This is a cross-platform GUI application for modding cards in Plants vs Zombies Heroes.
This program can then be used to easily edit the stats, abilities, names, and
descriptions of all cards in the game, as well as adding new cards.

To use this app, create a folder with the contents of the game's `card_data_182` and
`en_281` asset files in the form of text files, named `cards.txt` and `localizedstrings.txt`
respectively. Modified files are edited in-place.
