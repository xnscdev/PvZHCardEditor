# PvZ Heroes Card Editor
This is a cross-platform GUI application for modding cards in Plants vs Zombies Heroes.
It can edit the stats, abilities, names, and descriptions of all cards in the game,
as well as add custom cards or delete existing cards.

To use this app, obtain the Unity asset files `card_data_172` and `en_281` from the game,
then create a folder and extract `cards` from `card_data_172` and `localizedstrings.csv`
from `en_281` with [UABE](https://github.com/SeriousCache/UABE). Rename the extracted files
to `cards.txt` and `localizedstrings.txt` respectively. Modified files are edited in-place.
